Mission 07: Grid Navigation (Alien Artifacts)

The Story: The orbital satellite has sent down a high-resolution grid map of your current sector. It’s not just a list of numbers anymore; it is a 2D coordinate system. The scan indicates a rare "Alien Artifact" is buried somewhere in this grid. You must program the Rover to scan the map, row by row and column by column, to locate the target coordinates.

The Objective:

Load the sector_map (a 2D Array) into the system.

Create a "Scanner" using Nested Loops to check every square.

Find the artifact (Value 2) and print its exact coordinates (Row and Column).

Coding Skills: 2D Arrays (map[row][col]), Nested Loops.
