Mission 03: Autonomous Loops (The Countdown)

The Story: The Rover needs to deploy its solar panels and run diagnostic drills. Doing these tasks manually (typing code 100 times) is inefficient. You need to teach the Rover to repeat tasks automatically until a job is done.

The Objective:

Create a "Launch Countdown" for the drone deployment.

Count down from T-Minus 10 to LIFTOFF.

Coding Skills: while loops, for loops, Increment/Decrement (i--).
