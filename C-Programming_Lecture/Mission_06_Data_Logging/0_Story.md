Mission 06: Data Logging (The Black Box)

The Story: EMERGENCY! A sandstorm is approaching, and the Rover's battery is critically low. If the power dies, the RAM (Variables) will be wiped clean. You must write a script to "Save" the vital sensor data to the hard drive (Text File) before the system shuts down.

The Objective:

Open a file named black_box.txt.

Write the final "Crash Report" into it.

Recover the data later to see what happened.

Coding Skills: File I/O (fopen, fprintf, fclose).
