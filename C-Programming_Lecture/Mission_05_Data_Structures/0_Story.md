Mission 05: Data Structures (Terrain Analysis)

The Story: The Rover has scanned a mountain range. It has returned a list of 6 different elevation points. Instead of looking at them one by one, you need to feed this list into the computer and have it automatically identify the highest peak for the Rover to climb.

The Objective:

Store the scan data in a list (Array).

Scan through the list to find the "King of the Hill" (Max Value).

Coding Skills: Arrays, Indexing ([0]), Iterating with Loops.
