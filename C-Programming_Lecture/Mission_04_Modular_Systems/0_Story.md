Mission 04: Modular Systems (The Upgrade)

The Story: The Rover's main computer is getting messy. The code is too long and hard to read. To prepare for complex scientific tasks, you need to organize the code into reusable "Tools" (Functions) so you don't have to rewrite the math every time you need to convert a temperature.

The Objective:

Build a dedicated "Temperature Converter" tool.

Teach the Rover to convert Martian temps (Fahrenheit) to Earth standards (Celsius) instantly.

Coding Skills: Functions, void vs return, Parameters, Scope.
