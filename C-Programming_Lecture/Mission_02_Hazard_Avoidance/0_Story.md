Mission 02: Navigation Systems (Hazard Avoidance)

The Story: Pathfinder is awake, but it is blind. It is sitting in front of a field of jagged rocks. If it drives forward blindly, it will crash and the mission will end. You must upload a "Brain" that lets it make decisions based on what its sensors see.

The Objective:

Read sensor data (Distance to rock, Size of rock).

Decide: Stop? Turn Left? Or Drive over it?

Coding Skills: if, else if, else, Logical Operators (&&, ==).
